# Investigating-the-Causes-of-JAMB-Failure-Rates-and-Predicting-Future-Performance-Trends-2020-2030-
A data-driven analysis of JAMB exam failure rates (2020–2025), with a predictive model forecasting trends to 2030. Key factors include study habits, school type, digital access, and gender — with targeted recommendations for improving outcomes.

## Project Overview
Over the past five years, the JAMB examination — Nigeria's standardized university entrance exam — has shown a noticeable trend in fluctuating failure rates. This project aims to explore the root causes behind this trend using data-driven research and build a predictive model to forecast performance trends from 2026 to 2030.

---

## Objectives
- Collect and analyze data from students who sat for the JAMB exam between 2020 and 2025.
- Identify socio-economic, academic, and behavioral factors affecting performance.
- Build a machine learning model to predict pass/fail outcomes.
- Forecast national pass/fail rates up to 2030.
- Recommend actionable strategies to reduce failure rates.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Survey Tool:** Google Forms  
- **Visualization Tool:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## Data Collection
Data was collected via a structured online survey distributed to individuals who wrote the JAMB examination between 2020 and 2025. The survey captured:

- **Demographics** (age, gender, state)  
- **Educational background** (school type, WAEC scores)  
- **Study behavior** (daily hours, study method)  
- **Socio-economic status** (parental education, internet/electricity access)  
- **Exam experience** (score, attempts, perceived difficulty)  
- **Support systems** (mentorship, online resources)

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Pass vs. Fail Rate Distribution
- **Pass Rate:** 78.2%  
- **Fail Rate:** 21.8%

**Insight:** Although most students passed, the 21.8% failure rate reveals a significant academic gap among candidates, especially those from underserved backgrounds. This calls for targeted support and equal learning opportunities.

---

### 2. Performance Trends by Year (2020–2025)
A downward trend in average scores and a rise in failure rates were observed from 2022 to 2024.

**Insight:** Likely influenced by the COVID-19 aftermath, inconsistent learning environments, and potential misalignments between curriculum and exam demands.

---

### 3. Impact of Study Habits
Students studying ≥3 hours daily scored higher on average.

**Insight:** Consistent, focused study routines are strongly linked to better performance and should be encouraged by both educators and families.

---

### 4. Access to Educational Resources
Students with internet and electricity access who used past questions and online platforms outperformed others.

**Insight:** The digital divide remains a major barrier. Bridging this gap is essential to equitable educational success.

---

### 5. School Type and Learning Environment
Private and mission school students had better outcomes than those from public or federal schools.

**Insight:** Improved resources, learning structures, and teaching quality likely contribute. Investment in public school infrastructure is needed to balance the scale.

---

### 6. Gender and Performance
- Males had higher pass rates and lower failure rates.
- Females had a slightly higher proportion of fails despite good participation.
- Nearly all students who selected "Prefer not to say" passed.

**Insight:** A subtle gender gap exists. Female students may face unique challenges such as reduced access to resources, domestic roles, or psychological pressure — requiring targeted support.

---

## Model Building & Evaluation

A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained on the cleaned dataset to predict pass/fail outcomes.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** 100%  
- **Precision:** 100%  
- **Recall:** 100%  
- **F1-Score:** 100%

### Top Predictive Features
- Study Hours  
- School Type  
- Past Questions Usage  
- Internet Access  
- Parental Education Level

## Future Forecast (2026–2030)

Simulated results using synthetic student records:

| Year | Predicted Pass Rate | Predicted Fail Rate |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 2026 | 79.5%               | 20.5%               |
| 2027 | 80.8%               | 19.2%               |
| 2028 | 82.0%               | 18.0%               |
| 2029 | 83.1%               | 16.9%               |
| 2030 | 84.7%               | 15.3%               |

## Actionable Recommendations

### For Students:
- Set consistent daily study routines (≥2 hours).
- Leverage free online JAMB prep tools, mobile apps, and past questions.
- Join peer study groups, tutorials, or mentorship circles — especially female students who may benefit from academic encouragement in male-dominated subjects.
- Encourage female students to pursue STEM-related subjects and build confidence using dedicated learning resources.

---

### For Educators:
- Integrate structured JAMB prep and mock exams into the school curriculum.
- Identify and support at-risk students early — especially girls who may be underperforming.
- Promote digital literacy and online resource use, especially in public schools.
- Facilitate gender-sensitive mentorship programs, pairing female students with role models.

---

### For Policymakers and Stakeholders:
- Improve electricity and internet access in underserved areas to reduce digital inequality — particularly for girls.
- Subsidize past questions, textbooks, and JAMB guides for low-income students.
- Train teachers in both digital and exam-specific pedagogy, focusing on inclusive and gender-aware strategies.
- Fund girl-focused academic programs and safe learning spaces in regions where female education is limited.

## Conclusion

This project presents a data-driven investigation into the factors contributing to JAMB failure rates and uses predictive analytics to forecast trends up to 2030. Our research highlights how access to resources, study patterns, school type, and socio-economic background influence outcomes far beyond raw academic ability.

A predictive model showed promising trends in improved performance over the next five years — but only if students receive the tools and support they need. Without systemic investment and targeted interventions, many disadvantaged students will continue to fall behind.

Improving JAMB outcomes will require collaboration between students, educators, policymakers, and communities. With focused action, we can close the gap, promote equality, and ensure better opportunities for every student — regardless of background or gender.
